# Passing FINRA exams: an outsider's perspective

### Background

My name is [Thomer Gil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomer-gil/). I am a software engineer by training, an engineering manager and CTO by experience, and a Founder/CEO of a startup by fortuity.

I have no formal training in finance, I never worked on or near Wall Street. But I found myself having to pass the [SIE](https://www.finra.org/registration-exams-ce/qualification-exams/securities-industry-essentials-exam), [Series 7](https://www.finra.org/registration-exams-ce/qualification-exams/series7), and [Series 24](https://www.finra.org/registration-exams-ce/qualification-exams/series24) exams. I passed all three within 4 months, each on my first try. It was among the hardest professional experiences I've had to go through.

I was often told this should be easy for me because I went to [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), but nothing could be further from the truth. It was brutal: most exams I did at MIT were easier for me than these FINRA exams.

This document shares some insights I gained along the way.

### Acknowledgments

My gratitude goes to [Brian Marks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-marks-9764027/) and [David Meshkov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmesher/), my tutors at [Knopman Marks](https://www.knopman.com/). (This post is not paid by them, nor advertising for them, nor necessarily my endorsement in all respects, though my path would have been much more difficult without them.) Also, I am grateful to [Arran Manu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arran-manu-b4671520/) for patiently providing me with help, insights, and strategy. Finally, [Matthew Cohen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-cohen-1722774b/), I should have listened to you immediately. Thank you for your advice.

### How NOT to study for it

**Don't read the book**: it's impossible, especially when it means nothing to you, which was the case for me. The book is reference material, not reading material.

**Don't study to understand the material**: I first naively started creating my own cliff notes based on reading materials and video lectures. While that is an excellent approach to thoroughly understand a subject matter, itâ€™s the wrong approach to pass these exams. You are welcome to actually study the subject matter at any other time, but you are not asked to understand the subject matter. You are asked to pick the right answer between 4 options roughly 70% of the time. That's what you need to study for.

**Don't use online flash cards**: I found them to be infuriating and useless.

**Don't show the running score when doing practice exams**: you will get discouraged and depressed and your results will suffer as a result.

### How to study for FINRA exams

1. Sign up for an online training course; I share some thoughts about that below.
2. Find a coach. Don't go it alone. Maybe you're better and smarter than I am, but I couldn't do it by myself without a mentor or coach to go over questions, answers, explanations, exams, and strategies.
3. Without having spent any time on the material, immediately take a sample test and watch yourself score 20-30%, as would be expected if you have a 1 in 4 chance of guessing the right answer.
4. Watch the video lectures, all of them. This step can easily take a week or more. Feel completely overwhelmed, confused, and angry at all the garbage you need to remember.
5. Do an exam of 50-150 questions covering all topics, maybe as 3 exams of 20-50 questions each. Don't display your running score, but do show the answers and explanations as you go. Read the explanations on why you are getting everything wrong. Don't write anything down yet. Get more infuriated and frustrated. You'll likely score slightly higher than in Step 3; maybe 30-40%.
6. Isolate the topic/chapter with the worst exam results; your online training course offers that feature, most likely.
7. Take tests just on that topic, don't display your running score, but do show the answers and explanations. This is the first opportunity where you can actually use the book: find the topic in the book if you continue to be confused. (Ideally you have a PDF copy; use the search function to search for keywords in the question.) Maybe even watch a lecture on the topic again.
8. Once you've improved your outcome by, say, 5-10% on the one topic, go back to Step 5 (do a new all-topics test), and find the next worst topic. To keep your mind fresh, alternate the worst-topic approach with the all-topics approach.
9. (Deal and acknowledge mid-study despair. Each time, roughly halfway, I had a moment of despair where I was certain I was never going to figure it out, never cover all the material, and never going to pass. Take a break, eat a snack, go for a bike ride, then go back at it. The despair came in waves for about 2-3 days for me.)
10. When you keep making the same mistakes or if you keep forgetting the same things, create a document and add your personalized cliff notes for those stupid lists, numbers, deadlines, durations, calendar dates, regulatory numbers, names, and abbreviations that you need to remember.
11. Come up with stupid mnemonics as much as possible, write them down in that document. Can't remember that 506(b) rather than 506(c) involves 35 non-accredited investors? How about this: "you have to BE 35 years-old to become President". Can't remember that it's a ".Z" modifier for late trade reporting? "Zzz" is for sleepy slow pokes. No mnemonic is too silly or too far fetched if it works for you.
12. If you can afford it, or if your sponsor is willing to pay for it: practice against multiple question banks. Each online training course has a different focus, a different style of questions. (More on that below.)
13. When the exam gets closer, do "benchmark" or "final" or "diagnostic" exams that these training sites offer. Afterwards, go over your answers, even your correct ones, and understand what you got wrong, why you got it wrong, make additional notes in your document. Dive into the stuff you're unsure about. If you have a coach, discuss it with them.
14. Print out the summary notes and your own notes, and use a highlighter to mark the topics that you feel you keep forgetting or that continue to surprise you. Keep going over those up until exam time.
15. Don't panic during the exam. I did in one of them. It didn't help me, and I passed anyway. The exams are designed to mess with your mind and confidence. Don't let FINRA do it to you.

### Online Training Courses

**Disclaimer**: I do not advise, recommend, or necessarily endorse any of these. This document intends to provide a strategy. This is not a fair or official evaluation of online training courses. I have an opinion only insofar it allowed me to pursue the strategy.

That said, in my process I ended up signing up for [Knopman Marks](https://www.knopman.com/) and [Securities Training Corporation](https://www.stcusa.com/) and [Solomon Exam Prep](https://solomonexamprep.com/). Each firm has its own flavor of video lectures and test exams, and each site has its pros and cons. (I did not sign up for [Kaplan Financial Training](https://www.kaplanfinancial.com/securities), so I can't say anything about them other than their interaction with [Knopman Marks](https://www.knopman.com/); see below.)

**Video lectures** on [Knopman Marks](https://www.knopman.com/) are by far the best, both in how they visually present the content and the voice-over. The videos can be occasionally irritating in that they are repetitive and repetitive, and sometimes repetitive. But maybe it's intentional. They can come across as belittling at times. But the quality easily compensates for it. Using the website can be confusing at times, as you're sent back and forth between two different websites for training material and exams (and even to a third, external, site for question banks). It is frustrating that the provided class notes (with copies of the slides used in the lecture) require you to fill in the answers by hand, so you can't use them later as reference material if you didn't write down the answers. Finally, the site logs you out all the time, which is irritating. But despite all that: the video lectures are very, very good. Hands down winner.

**Question banks**: for some of its courses [Knopman Marks](https://www.knopman.com/) has its own question banks, those are good. For some of their courses [Knopman Marks](https://www.knopman.com/) partners with Kaplan, which offers an infuriatingly bad question bank interface; but the questions themselves are high quality. (Find the Performance Tracker to see per topic scoring to see how you are doing.) I don't like that Kaplan's answer explanations often just lazily points you at "chapter 2" in the book rather than provide a full explanation.

Both [Securities Training Corporation](https://www.stcusa.com/) and [Solomon Exam Prep](https://solomonexamprep.com/) do a much better job at providing informative explanations to answers.

[Knopman Marks](https://www.knopman.com/) questions are probably the hardest, where [Securities Training Corporation](https://www.stcusa.com/) and [Solomon Exam Prep](https://solomonexamprep.com/) focus more on the basics: those are probably good to solidify knowledge in the beginning of your preparations. That said, I would not want to go into the actual exam having focused only on those basics. 

If you can choose only one question bank, choose [Knopman Marks](https://www.knopman.com/) (which, again, sometimes outsources to Kaplan). If you can choose two, add [Solomon Exam Prep](https://solomonexamprep.com/). If you have the luxury to choose a third, add [Securities Training Corporation](https://www.stcusa.com/).
